### Week One ###
I have planned out my codestack and what I'm going to build. I have chosen HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Fetch API for the front end.
PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js for the backend
bcrypt, JWT, helmet.js, and dotenv for the auth/security
pg for data


### Week Two ###
I have learned most the basics of git and github. 
I know how to commit and push properly. I only work on the main branch for now until I think the main branch is ready for production. Once it is released, I can then start branching out and "pushing to prod"
