# Collaboration MAIN BRANCH

git clone c:/path/path.git
cd path

git add .

git commit -m "This is a description of what I did"

git push -u origin main (the -u tag enables you to use 'git push' instead of 'git push origin main')

# Collaboration BUILDING AND UPLOADING A BRANCH

git checkout -b commentsSection (the -b tag creates the branch and switches the user to that branch)

*After adding in your changes for the branch*

git add .

git commit -m "this is a description to what I basically done"

git push origin commentsSection (or use "git push" since that works the same way after using the -u tag)
